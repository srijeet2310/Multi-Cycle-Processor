# This repository has the Verilog files for a 16 bit multicycle RISC processor
# The assignment pdf suggests the characteristics of the processor
# The instr_mem and data_mem contain randomly generated values for the data and instruction memory
# The processor has been tested by comparing its timing daigram with a standard test bench
